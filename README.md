# Unity Package Extractor

Unity Package Extractor is a Rust-based tool designed to efficiently extract assets from `.unitypackage` files.

## Some details

The tool parses Unity package files and extracts all the files in the working directory. It uses Rust's async/await feature to handle file I/O operations efficiently. It assumes that assets are always written before the path name to more efficiently extract the file without using too much buffer space. It is a command-line based tool but you can drag and drop a file on it to quickly extract. There is also robust logging if you add a couple -v.
